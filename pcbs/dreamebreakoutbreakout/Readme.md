On some new robots such as the Dreame L10S Ultra, the debug port is rotated so that the lidar tower cover collides
with the headers on the regular Dreame Breakout PCB.

This breakout breakout solves that problem in a way that greatly amuses me.

**Important:** <br/>
The PCB needs to be manufactured with 1.2mm thickness or else the robot-facing connector won't fit
