# Dreame Adapter PCBs for Valetudo

[<img src="./pcbs/dreamebreakout/img/breakout.png" width=750>](./pcbs/dreamebreakout/img/breakout.png)

This repository contains the resources to build the breakout PCBs required for rooting of Dreame Vacuum robots
as documented in the [Valetudo docs](https://valetudo.cloud).

These are the PCBs (click to jump to their respective readme):
- [Dreame Breakout](./pcbs/dreamebreakout/) - the main one you're looking for (including a step-by-step soldering guide!)
- [Dreame Breakout Breakout](./pcbs/dreamebreakoutbreakout)


Check out the [releases section](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-dreameadapter/releases) to find prebuilt gerber zips
that you can upload to the PCB manufacturer of your choice e.g. JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark, AISLER etc.

While designing these, I made sure to keep them relatively easy to solder by only using THT components so that they
and in turn rooting dreame robots is accessible to more people.

Still, this might not be for everyone. But please keep reading

## Acquiring a PCB

If you can solder but don't want to order a full batch of components and PCBs, I have a few kits lying around.<br/>
If you need one and are located somewhere where shipping from germany makes sense, you can ping me `@NotHypfer` on Telegram.

## Community building

Since ordering custom PCBs and soldering them might not be something everyone is comfortable with, 
maybe apart from connecting to robots, we can also connect to people?

If you 
- have built, received or otherwise acquired one of these PCBs and you'd like to help other people root their robots as well

or
- if you're looking for someone with a PCB or maybe general dreame rooting advice near you, 

consider joining [the dedicated telegram group](https://t.me/+FAXBhvFutfYxYzVi).

Ideally this would not only enable more people to root their robots but also build a community and provide an opportunity
to meet other people nearby that might share the same interests as you.

We'll see if and how this works out. I think it could be neat


Also, think of the telegram group as the MVP. Ideally, there would be something like a privacy-friendly user map
where you can add a marker at your general fuzzy location plus some contact information so that you can quickly find other users that live nearby.

Building the software for such a map has been on my ToDo list for quite a while now but as you can see it did not happen yet. :-)
If this idea sounds cool to you, feel free to take a shot at building it
